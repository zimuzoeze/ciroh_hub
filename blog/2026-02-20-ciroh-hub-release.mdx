For the past three years, CIROH Portal and DocuHub have greatly expanded the visibility of CIROH’s research and software products,
allowing hydrology professionals from across the community to explore and leverage each other’s developments to maximize their operational
benefits and enhance life-saving outcomes in domains like streamflow modeling, flood inundation mapping, and public outreach. However,
both sites have always experienced some overlap in their purposes, leading to occasional confusion that has hampered their efforts
to make CIROH research truly accessible to the community.

To address this, we are excited to introduce **CIROH Hub**: a fully unified platform that brings all CIROH resources together in one place. 

Visit [hub.ciroh.org](https://hub.ciroh.org) to explore the full breadth of CIROH’s research and resources, including dynamic collections
of community [datasets](/datasets), [applications](/apps), [courses](/courses), and [notebooks](/notebooks) through HydroShare, a listing of CIROH [publications](/publications) through the community Zotero
collection, extensive [documentation](/docs/products/intro) on CIROH’s tools and software, guidance on [accessing leading infrastructure](/docs/services/intro) for hydrological computing,
and much more.

## What's New in CIROH Hub
CIROH Hub preserves everything you relied on from CIROH Portal and DocuHub, while introducing powerful new features to enhance visibility, usability, and collaboration across the consortium.

### A Fresh Visual Experience
CIROH Hub launches with a dynamic new visual theme with interactive elements. The interface is designed to be engaging for first‑time users while improving navigation for returning visitors.

### Dedicated Jupyter Notebooks Portal

Previously, Jupyter Notebooks were posted under the “Datasets” section of the CIROH Portal — a location that didn’t reflect their purpose and made them harder to find.
CIROH Hub now offers a purpose‑built [“Notebooks” section](/notebooks), giving notebooks a clear identity and improving their accessibility. Notebook authors can have their resources surfaced by adding the keyword `ciroh_hub_notebook` in HydroShare.

### Public Directory of Working Groups

CIROH Hub now also includes CIROH's [Working Groups](/working-groups). We hope this resource will make it easy for researchers to identify working groups relevant to their work, enhancing collaboration and strengthening the consortium’s shared mission.

## Contributing to CIROH Hub

With all of the CIROH resources consolidated in one place, contributing your work has never been simpler. 
CIROH Hub enables you to share your resources with the community.

### Share Research via HydroShare

The “Research Portal” section of CIROH Hub hosts content from CIROH Portal and, like it, is open to community contributions.
Whether you’d like to share a web application, dataset, educational course, presentation, or Jupyter Notebook, any of these
resources can be easily surfaced onto CIROH Hub from HydroShare via the inclusion of [appropriate keyword tags and optional metadata](/contribute#hydroshare).

### Update HydroShare Tags

To coincide with the merger, new HydroShare tags have been established to populate resources in CIROH Hub.
While we expect to support the existing, deprecated set of keywords indefinitely, we recommend transitioning
your resources to use the new CIROH Hub keywords where possible.

A full list of current and deprecated HydroShare keywords is available on the [Contribute page](/contribute#hydroshare).
Please ensure the appropriate tags are applied to your resources in HydroShare.

### Add Publications via Zotero

Submitting your publications via Zotero ensures they appear in CIROH Hub’s consolidated publication listings, which allows the community to view, iterate on, and cite your research.
[Request access to the CIROH group library now](/contribute#zotero) to get started. 

### Contributing Documentation
If you’ve created a tool or software with useful documentation, the Documentation section of CIROH Hub is a great place to make that information easily accessible.
This documentation can be automatically mirrored from your project’s GitHub repository README.md, allowing you to meet CIROH’s open-science best practices while
keeping maintenance simple. To get started, [submit a request or PR through the CIROH Hub repository](/contribute#resources-documentation).

## Sunsetting CIROH Portal and DocuHub

With CIROH Hub taking over their roles, we will be winding down CIROH Portal and DocuHub in the coming weeks. As of Monday, February 16th, 2026, neither site will be updated with the latest content and features, though dynamically loaded content will continue to populate both sites. During this time, we strongly recommend updating your links and bookmarks to point to the new site to ensure continuity of service for your users and readers.

Both CIROH Portal and DocuHub will remain online until **Thursday, March 25th, 2026**. When that date arrives, both portal.ciroh.org and docs.ciroh.org will be converted into redirect domains that point to the corresponding locations on CIROH Hub.

### Accessibility Updates

While CIROH Hub’s visual refresh may be appealing, we are aware that the site’s new animated elements may pose challenges for users with visual focus or computer performance issues. As such, we plan to introduce a reduced-motion mode by the end of March to address these limitations, ensuring that CIROH Hub’s core pursuit of accessibility is truly honored in every sense of the word. This timeframe means that both CIROH Portal and DocuHub will remain available in their current forms until a fully accessible version of CIROH Hub is available, ensuring that everyone can continue to take full advantage of CIROH resources.

## Looking Ahead

CIROH’s strength lies in its community and dedication to open science. By centralizing access to CIROH’s resources, we aim to bring the consortium into closer collaboration, maximizing our effectiveness as we translate cutting-edge advancements into operational successes in water management and public safety.
