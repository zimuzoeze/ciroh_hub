## Setup for running CIROH Hub locally

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ciroh_hub.git
   cd ciroh_hub
   ```

2. **Install Node.js**: 
   Download and install the LTS version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en) if you don't have it already.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or 
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps

4. **Build for Production** (optional):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates static files in the `build` directory that can be deployed to a web server.

5. **Run Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   This will start a local development server at http://localhost:3000 
   
6. **View the Site**:
   Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the local version of CIROH Hub.

   > **Note:** Some features (for example, Zotero integrations and other third-party services) require API keys provided via a local `.env` file. If you want to view and test those integrations locally, create an `.env` file with the required keys/secrets before running the site. Without these values, the site will still run, but the affected integrations may be unavailable or show limited functionality.
